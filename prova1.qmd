A well-defined problem I\'ve been focusing on is how operators in safety-critical industries, like nuclear power, interact with machine learning-driven recommendations. In these environments, decision-making is often time-sensitive and can have severe consequences. Operators are not only required to make quick judgments but also need to trust and interpret the information provided by automation systems. As automation is increasingly used to augment human decision-making, it\'s essential to understand how operators respond to different types of machine learning explanations in these high-stakes scenarios.

Machine learning models, especially in complex systems like nuclear power plants, are often seen as black boxes by operators. While these systems may be highly effective at detecting patterns and providing recommendations, the lack of transparency about how they arrive at their conclusions can lead to distrust. If operators don\'t understand or can\'t explain why a recommendation was made, they may hesitate to follow it, even if the model is more accurate than their own judgment. This can result in slower decision-making or, in the worst case, mistakes due to misinterpretation of the system\'s outputs.

The key challenge is finding ways to make these machine learning systems interpretable without overwhelming the user. If we provide too much detail, we risk adding cognitive load, potentially distracting the operator from the task at hand. If we provide too little, we may leave them feeling insecure about the system\'s reliability. The goal is to strike a balance where operators can trust the system's recommendations and understand them well enough to use them in real-time decision-making.

In my PhD, I specifically focused on understanding how different types of explanations---normative, contrastive, and counterfactual---affect human performance and trust when interacting with machine learning systems. Normative explanations provide a standard or rule for why a recommendation was made. Contrastive explanations, on the other hand, show what *didn\'t* happen, helping users understand why one outcome was chosen over another. Finally, counterfactual explanations illustrate what would have happened had a different decision been made, offering operators a glimpse into potential alternative outcomes.

These three types of explanations---each with its own strengths and weaknesses---can have different impacts on operator reliance and trust. For example, contrastive explanations can help clarify the reasoning behind machine learning decisions by drawing attention to the most relevant differences in outcomes. On the other hand, counterfactual explanations can offer operators a clearer sense of control by showing them the effects of different choices. Normative explanations can be valuable in providing a baseline or framework for understanding how the system functions. However, the challenge is that no single explanation type works universally across all tasks or operators. Some people may prefer one type of explanation over another, depending on their cognitive style or their prior experience with automation.

By studying how these explanations impact operator trust, reliance, and task performance, we can better design machine learning systems that enhance human decision-making. This is especially important in environments like nuclear power plants, where operators are expected to integrate machine learning recommendations into their decision-making processes while maintaining high safety standards. Providing clear, transparent, and relevant explanations can help operators use these systems more effectively, leading to more efficient operations and, ultimately, safer outcomes.
