I am a research scientist specializing in human-automation interaction within safety-critical systems, with eight years of experience spanning academia, industry, and research institutes. My work focuses on designing computational technologies that augment human decisions and safety rather than replace human input. My methods involve human-in-the-loop simulations, controlled experiments, human performance measurement, applied statistics, and machine learning.

I offer **consulting, assessments, and training** to help teams:\
✔ Improve human-AI collaboration.\
✔ Align AI explainability with decision-making needs.\
✔ Meet safety and regulatory standards.
