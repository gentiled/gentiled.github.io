Hello, welcome to this website.

I'm a researcher specializing in human-automation interaction, with experience in the design and evaluation of digital systems in safety-critical industries. My work focuses on improving human performance through automated aids. My methods involve human-in-the-loop simulations, controlled experiments, human performance measurement, applied statistics, and machine learning.

I offer **consulting, assessments, and training** to help teams:\
✔ Improve human-AI collaboration.\
✔ Align AI explainability with decision-making needs.\
✔ Meet safety and regulatory standards.
