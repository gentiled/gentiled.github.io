Hello, my name is Davide Gentile.

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Cognitive Engineering Lab (CEL) at the University of Toronto.

My research focuses on developing systems and technologies that augment human performance and mitigate human errors, while supporting individual and societal well-being. Specifically, I work on supervisory control of automation, decision support systems and feedback mechanisms (e.g., transparency, explainability) that guide user behavior effectively.

My research at CEL focuses on human performance in modern nuclear operations. Here, I lead a team of researchers on conducting experiments to study problems in supervisory control of small modular reactors.
