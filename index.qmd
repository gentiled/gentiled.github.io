## **Human Factors + AI Risk**

#### **Davide Gentile**

I help people design AI they can trust. From nuclear control rooms to insurance models, I study how humans interact with AI and design ways to make systems reliable and safe. I\'ve led human-in-the-loop research projects, advised regulators, and evaluated AI for bias and compliance. Right now, I\'m developing a human-centered framework to measure the reliability of AI evaluations. You can check out my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hpdB69EAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [projects](projects.qmd) to see what I\'ve worked on.
