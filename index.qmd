I'm a human factors researcher focused on decision automation. I design systems, workflows, and products that support task performance, reduce time on the task, and manage workload.

Currently, I lead experimental research in nuclear operations at the Cognitive Engineering Lab, University of Toronto. Previously, I was an AI risk consultant at Armilla AI, a human--ML interaction researcher at the Schwartz Reisman Institute, and a research intern at Ericsson's Global AI Accelerator.

I recently completed a PhD on explainable AI, studying how machine learning explanations affect human reliance on automated results.

I'm interested in concrete problems in human--automation interaction. I try to avoid hype and doom-talk.
