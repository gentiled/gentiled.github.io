I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Cognitive Engineering Laboratory (CEL) at the University of Toronto.

My research interests focus on developing systems and technologies that augment human performance and mitigate human errors, while supporting individual and societal well-being. Specifically, I work on supervisory control of automation, decision support systems and feedback mechanisms (e.g., transparency, explainability) that guide user behavior effectively.

At CEL, I lead a team of researchers on conducting experiments to study problems in supervisory control of small modular reactors.
