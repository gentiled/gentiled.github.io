## Human Factors + AI Risk

##### Davide Gentile

I specialize in human factors and AI risk in safety-critical environments, from nuclear control rooms to ML models for insurance. My work combines human-in-the-loop studies, explainable AI, and human performance measurement to support reliability, safety, and regulatory compliance. I'm developing a framework to assess the reliability of AI evaluations through a human factors lens, filling a gap in technical AI governance.
