## Davide Gentile

Hi, thanks for visiting.

I\'m a postdoc and lead researcher at the university of toronto, where I work on how people interact with machines and automation in safety-critical environments, most recently in the context of small modular reactors.

My past work spans AI risk, human--machine learning interaction, and system usability across sectors like energy, insurance, telecom, and academia. I hold a phd in human factors and explainable AI. You can find my academic publications [here](publications.qmd), and a plain-language explanation of my dissertation [here](dissert.qmd).

As of June 2025 I'm a member of [z-inspection](https://z-inspection.org/), a process to assess trustworthy AI.

I provide consulting in user evaluations and AI risk assessment, helping organizations build effective and safe human--AI systems.
