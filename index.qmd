I help organizations improve how people interact with AI systems in high-risk environments by identifying breakdowns in trust, usability, and decision quality. My approach is grounded in experimental human factors methods.

I work with teams deploying AI in safety-critical workflows, building explainable decision-support tools, or researching human--automation interaction.

**How I can help:**

-   Audit and analysis of human--AI workflows (trust, reliability, workload)

-   Design and interpretation of behavioral experiments

-   Advising on explainability, human--ML interaction, and decision support UX

-   Collaborative research and white papers

Currently, I lead experimental research in nuclear operations at the Cognitive Engineering Lab, University of Toronto. Past roles include AI risk consultant at Armilla AI, human--ML interaction researcher at the Schwartz Reisman Institute, and intern at Ericsson's Global AI Accelerator.

I recently completed a PhD on explainable AI, studying how machine learning explanations affect human reliance on automated results.

I'm interested in concrete problems in human-automation interaction, and try to avoid hype and doom-talk.
