I help organizations improve how people interact with AI systems in high-risk environments by identifying breakdowns in trust, usability, and decision quality. My approach is grounded in [experimental human factors](posts/exp-hf.qmd) methods.

I work with teams deploying AI in safety-critical workflows, building explainable decision-support tools, or researching human use of automation.

#### How I can help:

-   Evaluation of human--AI workflows (trust, reliability, workload)

-   Design and analysis of behavioral experiments

-   Advising on ML explainability and decision support UX

-   Collaborative research, white papers, and technical writing

<!-- I'm a human factors researcher focused on decision automation. I design systems, workflows, and products that support task performance, reduce time on the task, and manage workload. -->

<!-- Currently, I lead experimental research in nuclear operations at the Cognitive Engineering Lab, University of Toronto. Previously, I was AI risk consultant at Armilla AI, researcher in human--ML interaction at the Schwartz Reisman Institute, and research intern at Ericsson's Global AI Accelerator. -->

<!-- I recently completed a PhD on explainable AI, studying how machine learning explanations affect human reliance on automated results. -->

<!-- I'm interested in concrete problems in human--automation interaction. I try to avoid hype and doom-talk. -->
