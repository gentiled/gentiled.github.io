Automation without human-centered design can introduce risk in safety-critical industries rather than reduce it. I specialize in ensuring that automation supports, rather than overwhelms, human operators in safety-critical environments.

<!--🔹 **Human Factors in AI and Automation**

Optimizing human-AI collaboration to reduce cognitive load and enhance usability in high-stakes decision-making environments.


🔹 **Explainability & Trust**

Designing transparent machine learning explanations that align with human decision-making to calibrate trust and improve system performance.


🔹 **Regulatory Compliance**

Ensuring AI-driven automation meets NRC, IAEA, and CNSC standards, ensuring safety and regulatory adherence. -->
