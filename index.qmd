<!-- ## Davide Gentile

**Hi, welcome to my website**

I'm a researcher and analyst specializing in human-automation interaction in safety-critical environments, most recently in the context of small modular reactors. I hold a phd in human-in-the-loop explainability, a field that studies how to design AI systems that are transparent and usable for the people who use them.

My past work spans AI risk, human-machine learning interaction, and system usability across energy, insurance, telecom, and academia. You can find my academic publications [here](publications.qmd).

As of June 2025, I am a member of z-inspection, an international initiative dedicated to evaluating AI systems.

I offer consulting services in user evaluations and AI risk assessment.
