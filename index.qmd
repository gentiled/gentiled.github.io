Previously, I was AI risk consultant at Armilla AI, researcher in human--ML interaction at the Schwartz Reisman Institute, and research intern at Ericsson's Global AI Accelerator. -->

<!-- I recently completed a PhD on explainable AI, studying how machine learning explanations affect human reliance on automated results. -->

<!-- I'm interested in concrete problems in human--automation interaction. I try to avoid hype and doom-talk. -->
