In collaboration with a group comprising doctoral and postdoctoral researchers from the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society, we adopted a multidisciplinary perspective to understand how machine learning systems can earn and maintain human trust. We are preparing a paper on this research inclusive of findings and suggestions for further inquiry.
