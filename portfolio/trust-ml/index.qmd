title: "A Multidisciplinary Perspective on Trust in Human-ML Interaction"
author: "Davide Gentile"
description: "This project explores the role of trust in human interactions with AI across diverse contexts of use. In collaboration with a multidisciplinary team at the Schwartz Reisman Institute, we examined how trust impacts user adoption, ethics, and societal effects. We are preparing a white paper on reliance, limitations, and the risks of misplaced trust in AI, highlighting the need for a cross-disciplinary understanding of trust to build more trustworthy and effective AI systems."

In collaboration with a group comprising doctoral and postdoctoral researchers from the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society, we adopted a multidisciplinary perspective to understand how machine learning systems can earn and maintain human trust. We are preparing a paper on this research inclusive of findings and suggestions for further inquiry.
