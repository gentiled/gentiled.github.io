title: "Understanding Trust in Human-ML Interaction"
author: "Davide Gentile"
description: "This project explores trust in human interactions with AI across diverse contexts of use. In collaboration with a multidisciplinary team at the Schwartz Reisman Institute, we examined how trust impacts user adoption, ethics, and societal effects. We are preparing a white paper on reliance, limitations, and the risks of misplaced trust in AI, highlighting the need for a cross-disciplinary understanding of trust to build more trustworthy and effective AI systems."

This project leveraged fleet telematics data to inform usage-based insurance models for corporate vehicle fleets. We compared machine learning algorithms to predict collision risk in real-time driving behavior data from 3,854 corporate vehicle drivers. The analysis identified key factors that influenced collision involvement, such as driving time, trip frequency, and rapid speed changes. Fleet rental companies can use these insights to adjust insurance rates based on risky driver behaviors. This project contributes to the development of more accurate risk models and improved operational strategies for commercial fleet services.
