### Background

The increasing automation of small modular reactors (SMRs) introduces new challenges for human operators in nuclear control rooms. Effective monitoring and control require maintaining situation awareness and workload balance, but traditional assessment methods lack validity and reliability in these high-stakes environments. Additionally, the diversity of SMR designs complicates the development of standardized human factors guidelines to ensure safe and efficient operation.

Starting September 2024, I am leading experimental and analytical projects in a new research program aimed at addressing these gaps. The research program focuses on two key objectives: improving methodologies for assessing situation awareness (SA) and workload in nuclear control rooms, and developing a taxonomy to categorize SMR designs and their impact on human performance. The first experiment tests multiple (SA) and workload measures across different automation levels. A parallel project is creating a taxonomy to guide human factors guidelines for varying SMR designs.

The project aims to establish better performance metrics and standardized operational guidelines, supporting safety and efficiency in the nuclear sector. This research is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission.

### Methods

This research program addresses these challenges through two parallel projects:

#### Project 1: Experiment on Operator Performance & Automation

-   I designed an experiment using the [RANCOR microworld platform](https://inlsoftware.inl.gov/product/rancor-microworld) to simulate the operation of small modular reactors under routine and abnormal scenarios.

-   Tested 24 participants and collected multiple metrics of situation awareness and workload across three levels of automation in computerized procedures. The three levels of automation in the computerized procedures are defined according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard 1786 (IEEE, 2022): **Type I** procedure displays the instructions on a screen, resembling a traditional paper-based procedure; **Type II** can additionally display process data and step logic, visualize results, and provide access links to displays and soft controls; **Type III** has the additional capability to automatically carry out sequences in the procedure and has embedded soft control features.

-   Evaluated situation awareness, cognitive workload, decision-making, and reaction time using a within-subjects experimental design with three counterbalanced conditions corresponding to the level of automation in the computerized procedures (Table I).

#### Project 2: Development of an SMR Taxonomy

-   My team is leading the development of a taxonomy that categorizes key design variations in SMRs, including levels of automation, control systems, and operational phases. This work identifies implications for task performance, cognitive workload, and situational awareness, providing a structured framework to inform human factors guidelines and improve safety in nuclear operations.

### Key Findings

Findings will be presented at the *Nuclear Plant Instrumentation and Control & Human-Machine Interface Technology (NPIC&HMIT)* meeting in Chicago in June 2025.

### Implications

This research supports regulatory agencies and nuclear operators in defining best practices for safe SMR operations by providing validated methodologies for assessing operator performance. It also helps engineers and system designers optimize automation levels and control interfaces to enhance human performance in nuclear control rooms.
