I'm a Human Factors engineer who translates research into practical improvements for human-machine systems. I specialize in mixed-methods approaches including human-in-the-loop simulations, statistical inference, and cognitive task analysis. My work ensures technology enhances human abilities, meets industry standards, and delivers effective and enjoyable experiences.

Over the past six years, I've worked across safety-critical industries, from nuclear power plants to telecommunications to insurance risk models. What drives me is the belief that thoughtful human factors research can prevent accidents and help people perform at their best when it matters most.

Currently, I work as a human factors consultant at Kinectrics, where I help organizations implement evidence-based insights to reduce risk and improve performance in safety-critical systems. This builds directly on my postdoctoral research that informed nuclear safety regulations.

I value authenticity, cultivating connections with people, staying curious, appreciating nature, and finding meaning in work. I believe the best engineering solutions come from understanding both the technical systems and the people who operate them, which requires getting into the real world and using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods.
