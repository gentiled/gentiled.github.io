<!--I specialize in human factors research and data science, focusing on human-AI interaction and decision-making in safety-critical systems. My work integrates human-subjects experimentation, machine learning explainability, and UX research to enhance trust, usability, and performance in high-stakes domains.

As Team Lead at the Cognitive Engineering Laboratory (University of Toronto), I oversee five research projects on human factors in nuclear safety. My [PhD dissertation](https://utoronto.scholaris.ca/items/01bf5af5-98ce-4a35-9a99-3f482c17a5a6) (2024) examines human-AI collaboration in industrial process control, specifically how machine learning explanations influence operator trust, performance, and cognitive workload. You can learn more about my research [here](publications.qmd).

I thrive in cross-functional teams, collaborating to turn data into practical solutions that support user experiences and human performance. My goal is to make automation intuitive and empowering for people. I also dedicate time to [teaching](courses.qmd) and mentoring, particularly in human factors, statistics, and design of experiments. -->

Automation should empower human operators, not replace them. I specialize in applying **human factors** and **usability** science to ensure that AI systems in **safety-critical industries** enhance performance, trust, and compliance.

I have a background in human-AI interaction, cognitive engineering, and regulatory compliance. I help organizations design **automation that works for people**. My expertise includes machine learning explainability, decision-support design, and usability assessments in high-stakes domains like nuclear energy, aerospace, healthcare, and defense.

I offer **consulting, assessments, and training** to help teams:\
âœ” Improve human-AI collaboration.\
âœ” Align AI explainability with decision-making needs.\
âœ” Meet safety and regulatory standards.

ðŸ“© [**Contact me**](mailto:gentiledv@gmail.com) to discuss how we can optimize your human-AI system for usability, trust, and safety.
