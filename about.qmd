I'm a human factors researcher specializing in decision automation. My work focuses on designing products and workflows that benefit human performance.

My PhD research examined how different types of machine learning explanations, such as normative, contrastive, and counterfactual, impact human ability to detect AI errors during a condition-based maintenance task. The work involved mostly human-in-the-loop experiments and was published in the *Journal of Artificial Intelligence* and the *International Journal of Human-Computer Studies*. The findings offer practical guidance for designing automation that aligns with human judgment and behavior.

I'm drawn to well-defined problems in human-automation interaction, and I like trying to define them myself. I also try to avoid hype and doom-talk.
