Hello,

I am **Team Lead of Analysis and Experimentation** at the Cognitive Engineering Laboratory (University of Toronto), where I conduct human factors research for nuclear applications.

I specialize in human-subjects experimentation, statistics, machine learning, and UX research. My experience includes academic [research](publications.qmd) and [training](courses.qmd), [data science](portfolio/ubi/index.qmd), and [industrial R&D](portfolio/ux-ericsson/index.qmd). My [PhD dissertation](https://utoronto.scholaris.ca/items/01bf5af5-98ce-4a35-9a99-3f482c17a5a6) (2024) focused on human-AI collaboration in industrial process control, specifically on evaluating the impact of machine learning explanations on operator performance.

I thrive in cross-functional teams, collaborating with engineers, designers, and business leaders to translate data into action. My goal is to make automation intuitive and effective for people through human-centered design, bridging technical and user needs.
