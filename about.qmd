I'm a human factors researcher specializing in experimental methods and decision automation. My work focuses on designing products and workflows that benefit human performance. Currently, I lead research on human performance in nuclear operations at the Cognitive Engineering Lab, University of Toronto.

Previously, I worked as an AI risk consultant at Armilla AI, a human--ML interaction researcher at the Schwartz Reisman Institute, and a research intern at Ericsson\'s Global AI Accelerator.

I recently completed a PhD in explainable AI, where I studied how machine learning explanations affect human reliance on automated decisions.

I\'m interested in concrete problems in human--automation interaction, and I try to avoid hype and doom-talk.
