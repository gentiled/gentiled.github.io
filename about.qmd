I'm a human factors analyst specialized in safety-critical automation. In the past year, I've been thinking about how AI can be applied in nuclear environments for more efficient operations and augmentation of human work.

My background is in human performance, explainability, and industrial operations. In my PhD, I studied how different types of machine learning explanations (normative, contrastive and counterfactual) affect people's decisions, trust, response time and workload in industrial control tasks, specifically condition-based maintenance. This work was published in the *Journal of Artificial Intelligence* and the *International Journal of Human-Computer Studies*.

I like well-defined problems in human-automation interaction. I don't like over-optimism and -pessimism. I write to sharpen my thinking and share what I'm learning.
