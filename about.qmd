I'm a human factors analyst specializing in human-AI interaction and experimental methods. I've worked in research roles across industrial process control, insurance, and telecommunications to evaluate and improve how AI systems perform in real-world use, focusing on reliability, risk, and user trust.

Currently, I lead human performance research in nuclear operations at the University of Toronto's Cognitive Engineering Lab. I recently got a PhD in human factors and explainable AI, where I focused on how machine learning explanations affect maintenance operators' ability to spot errors in automated recommendations.

Before this, I consulted on AI risk at Armilla AI, researched human--ML interaction at the Schwartz Reisman Institute, and interned at Ericsson's Global AI Accelerator.

Let's talk if you look to make AI systems that work for people effectively, efficiently, and safely.
