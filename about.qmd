I specialize in applying human factors and statistical methods to support the design of digital systems in **safety-critical industries**.

I have a background in human-AI interaction, cognitive engineering, and regulatory compliance. I help organizations design **automation that works for people**. My expertise includes machine learning explainability, decision-support design, and usability assessments in high-stakes domains like nuclear energy, aerospace, healthcare, and defense.
