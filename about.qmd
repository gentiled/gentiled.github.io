I am a human factors analyst specializing in human-AI interaction and experimental methods. I currently lead human factors research in nuclear operations at the University of Toronto\'s Cognitive Engineering Lab.Â 

I recently completed a PhD in human factors and explainable AI, focusing on how machine learning explanations affect maintenance operators\' ability to detect errors in automated recommendations.

Prior to my current role, I consulted on AI risk at Armilla AI, researched human--ML interaction at the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society, and interned at Ericsson\'s Global AI Accelerator.

Industries served: nuclear, healthcare, automotive, aerospace & aviation, industrial products, consumer products & services, software, web, and mobile applications.
