I help organizations design intuitive automation by combining human factors research with AI technologies. I specialize in human-subjects experimentation, machine learning, and [UX methods](portfolio/ux-ericsson/index.qmd) to make systems and products effective for a diverse range of users.

As Team Lead of Analysis & Experimentation at the Cognitive Engineering Laboratory (University of Toronto), I focus on applied research in high-stakes environments, particularly nuclear safety systems. My [PhD dissertation (2024)](https://utoronto.scholaris.ca/items/01bf5af5-98ce-4a35-9a99-3f482c17a5a6) examined human-AI collaboration in industrial process control, evaluating how machine learning explanations impact operator performance. Read more about [my research](publications.qmd).

I excel in cross-functional teams, turning data into practical solutions that improve user experiences and human performance. My goal is to make automation an empowering tool for people, not a barrier. I also dedicate time to [teaching](courses.qmd) and mentoring, guiding others to apply human-centered research in technical fields.
