Hello, my name is Davide Gentile.

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Cognitive Engineering Laboratory (CEL) at the University of Toronto.

My research focuses on developing systems that augment human performance and mitigate human errors, while supporting individual and societal well-being. Specifically, I work on supervisory control of automation, human-system performance evaluation, and feedback mechanisms (e.g., transparency, explainability) that guide user behavior effectively.

I have a background in cognitive science, computational linguistics and human-computer interaction. In my current role at CEL, I lead a team of researchers on conducting experiments to study problems in supervisory control of small modular reactors.
