#### Hello

I am a **data science and R&D leader** with a background in **cognitive science of language** and **human factors engineering**. My experience spans academic research, industrial R&D, and applied data science.

I have a strong foundation in **experimental design, machine learning, and quantitative UX research**, and specialize in developing data solutions that enhance human decision-making and optimize user experiences. I thrive in cross-functional environments, collaborating with engineers, designers, and business leaders to align analytics with real-world applications. My goal is to make data work for people, not the other way around.
