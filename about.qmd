<!--I specialize in human factors research and data science, focusing on human-AI interaction and decision-making in safety-critical systems. My work integrates human-subjects experimentation, machine learning explainability, and UX research to enhance trust, usability, and performance in high-stakes domains.

As Team Lead at the Cognitive Engineering Laboratory (University of Toronto), I oversee five research projects on human factors in nuclear safety. My [PhD dissertation](https://utoronto.scholaris.ca/items/01bf5af5-98ce-4a35-9a99-3f482c17a5a6) (2024) examines human-AI collaboration in industrial process control, specifically how machine learning explanations influence operator trust, performance, and cognitive workload. You can learn more about my research [here](publications.qmd).

I thrive in cross-functional teams, collaborating to turn data into practical solutions that support user experiences and human performance. My goal is to make automation intuitive and empowering for people. I also dedicate time to [teaching](courses.qmd) and mentoring, particularly in human factors, statistics, and design of experiments. -->

I specialize in **human-AI interaction** and **decision-making** for **safety-critical systems**. My expertise lies in designing automated systems for high-risk industries like nuclear energy, aerospace, and automation, ensuring that AI supports, rather than replaces, human decision-making.

As Team Lead at the Cognitive Engineering Laboratory (University of Toronto), I oversee five research projects on human factors in nuclear safety. My [PhD dissertation](https://utoronto.scholaris.ca/items/01bf5af5-98ce-4a35-9a99-3f482c17a5a6) (2024) examined human-AI collaboration in industrial process control, specifically how machine learning explanations influence operator trust, performance, and cognitive workload. can learn more about my research [here](publications.qmd).

My research has been published in journals such as \[Journal Name\] and presented at top industry conferences, covering topics like human-AI collaboration, cognitive load, and decision-making in critical systems. You can explore my full list of publications \[here\].

My work focuses on the intersection of **machine learning explainability, human-centered design,** and **regulatory compliance**, with the goal of improving operator trust, performance, and safety. I believe that human-centered AI is the key to unlocking the true potential of automation in critical environments. I strive to build AI solutions that enhance usability, boost trust, and reduce errors, ultimately making automation intuitive and empowering for people in high-risk settings.

I provide **consulting, research, and training services**, including AI explainability assessments, human factors evaluations, and regulatory compliance guidance for industries where safety and performance are paramount.
