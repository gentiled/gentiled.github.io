I'm a human factors analyst specializing in human-AI interaction and experimental methods. I've worked in research roles across industrial process control, insurance, and telecommunications to evaluate and improve how AI systems perform in real-world use, focusing on reliability, risk, and user trust.

Currently, I lead human performance research in nuclear operations at the University of Toronto's Cognitive Engineering Lab. I got a PhD in human factors and explainable AI, where I focused on how machine learning explanations affect user reliance on automated recommendations in reliability maintenance.

Before this, I consulted on AI risk at Armilla AI, researched human--ML interaction at the Schwartz Reisman Institute, and interned at Ericsson's Global AI Accelerator.

I\'m \[Your Name\], a human factors scientist and UX strategist specializing in AI systems where trust, safety, and usability aren\'t optional---they\'re critical. With a PhD focused on human-in-the-loop machine learning and years of hands-on experience designing and evaluating AI tools, I help teams build products people actually rely on.

My work sits at the intersection of human psychology, machine learning, and interface design. I use experimental methods and real-world data to uncover how users interact with AI---spotting hidden breakdowns in trust, workload, and decision quality before they cause costly failures.

Whether it\'s safety-critical systems in healthcare, energy, or automation, I bring a clear, evidence-driven approach to human-centered AI design. If you want your AI tools to be not just smart, but usable, trustworthy, and impactful, we should talk.
