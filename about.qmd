Hello, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Cognitive Engineering Laboratory (CEL) at the University of Toronto.

My research focuses on designing automation tools that augment human performance. Specifically, I work on supervisory control of automation, human-system performance evaluation, and feedback mechanisms (e.g., transparency, explainability) that guide user behavior effectively.

In my current role at CEL, I lead a team of human factors researchers conducting experiments in monitoring and control of small modular reactors.
