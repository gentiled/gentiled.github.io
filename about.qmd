I research how people interact with technology in real-world settings. I use a range of methods to inform evidence-based design and policy.

In earlier roles, I have led research programs on topics ranging from operation of small modular reactors to machine learning explainability, and have consulted on data science and model evaluation. I trained many students in statistics, human factors, and system design.
