#### Hello

I am **Team Lead, Analysis and Experimentation** in the Cognitive Engineering Laboratory at the University of Toronto, where I conduct applied research to enhance human performance and safety in monitoring and control of nuclear reactors. My experience spans academic research, industrial R&D, and applied data science.

I have a background in linguistics, cognitive science and industrial engineering, finishing my PhD in 2024. I specialize in applying **experimental methods,** **machine learning**, and **quantitative UX research** to improve human decision-making and user experiences. I thrive in cross-functional environments, working closely with engineers, designers, and business leaders to make data useful. My goal is to make data work for people, not the other way around.

I live between Ontario (Canada) and Abruzzo (Italy). You can find me on LinkedIn.
