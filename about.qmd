👋 Hello, my name is davide gentile

I'm a researcher specializing in statistics, machine learning, and human-subjects experiments

Over the past few years, I've led and contributed to diverse projects, publications, and courses. I currently **lead two research teams** in conducting experiments on human performance in monitoring and control of small modular reactors.

Since july 2024 I hold a phd in industrial engineering from the university of toronto. During my phd, i've had the pleasure to train 400+ engineering students in **statistics** and **human factors**

The picture was taken at anixerpasshütte (🏔️ 2407 m), a mountain cabin in glarus süd, switzerland, on august 30th 2024 around 9 pm
