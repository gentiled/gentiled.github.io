I'm a human factors researcher specializing in decision automation. I use experimental methods to improve how products and workflows support human performance. Currently, I lead human performance research in nuclear operations at the Cognitive Engineering Lab, University of Toronto.

I recently completed a PhD in explainable AI, where I focused on how machine learning explanations affect user reliance on automated recommendations in reliability maintenance.

Previously, I worked as AI risk consultant at Armilla AI, as human--ML interaction researcher at the Schwartz Reisman Institute, and as research intern at Ericsson\'s Global AI Accelerator.

I\'m interested in concrete problems in human--automation interaction, and I try to avoid hype and doom-talk.
