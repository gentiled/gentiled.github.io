ðŸ‘‹ hello, my name is davide gentile

i am a **data scientist** who uses causal inference to detect the signal in the noise

i currently **lead the experimental team** in the cognitive engineering lab at the university of toronto. i have previously worked as independent **data science consultant** at armilla ai, as **research intern** at ericsson, and as **researcher** at the center for advanced research on applied and experimental linguistics

the terms "signal" and "noise" are borrowed from signal detection theory, a framework used to measure the ability to differentiate between important information (the signal) from irrelevant information (the noise)
