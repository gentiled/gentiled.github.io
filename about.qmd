I am a researcher specialized in human-automation interaction and human-machine performance evaluation. My work focuses on supporting people's tasks and decisions through automated aids in safety-critical industries. I use a mix of methods, but mostly controlled experiments, applied statistics, and machine learning.

I completed my PhD in 2024 at the University of Toronto with a dissertation on the effects of machine learning explanations on human decisions and performance. Currently, I lead a team of human factors researchers conducting experimental projects on decision automation in nuclear operations.
