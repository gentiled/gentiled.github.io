I apply human factors engineering methods to product and system design, ensuring technology enhances human abilities while meeting regulations.

I specialize in mixed methods research, using human-in-the-loop simulations, statistical inference, and cognitive walkthroughs to evaluate design concepts and inform future developments for diverse user populations. Over the past six years, I've worked across nuclear power, telecommunications, and insurance risk modeling, helping organizations reduce risk, improve performance, and optimize user experience.

Currently, I work as human factors consultant at Kinectrics, building on postdoc research that informed nuclear safety regulations. In previous roles, I've led user studies and collaborated with cross-functional teams across design, engineering, product marketing, and development.

I value authenticity, curiosity, real-world engagement, and appreciation of nature. I believe the best engineering solutions come from understanding both technical systems and the people who operate them, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches to make technology effective, safe, and enjoyable to use.
