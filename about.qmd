I'm a researcher specializing in human-automation interaction, with experience in the design and evaluation of digital systems in safety-critical industries. My work focuses on improving human performance through automated aids. My methods involve human-in-the-loop simulations, controlled experiments, human performance measurement, applied statistics, and machine learning.

I completed my PhD in 2024 at the University of Toronto with a dissertation on the effects of machine learning explanations on human decisions and performance. Currently, I lead a team of human factors researchers conducting experimental projects on decision automationi in nuclear operations.
