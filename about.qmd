Hello

I am **Team Lead of Analysis and Experimentation** in the Cognitive Engineering Laboratory at the University of Toronto, where I conduct applied research to improve human performance in monitoring and control of small modular reactors.

My experience spans academic research, industrial R&D, and applied data science. I specialize in using mixed methods - experiments, statistics, machine learning, UX research - to improve human decision-making and user experiences.

I thrive in cross-functional teams, collaborating with engineers, designers, and business leaders to make data useful. My goal is to make automation work for people, not the other way around.
