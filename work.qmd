Currently I work as human factors analyst at Kinectrics, an engineering consulting firm working in the energy and medical industries.

## Projects

Selected past projects:

::: {#sample-listings}

:::

-   **Human Performance in Operation of Small Modular Reactors**\
    *Team Lead, University of Toronto, 2025*\
    Directed an experimental research program informing the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission's emerging regulations on small modular reactors (SMRs). Developed proposals for CNSC-NSERC on human performance measurement, automation integration, multi-unit operations, and the impact of SMR deployment on the affected communities.

-   **User-in-the-Loop Experiments in Machine Learning Explainability**\
    *PhD researcher, University of Toronto, 2024*\
    Led user experiments to test how different forms of explanation affected user ability to spot incorrect machine learning results. Demonstrated that combining normative, contrastive, and counterfactual explanations improved effective reliance but also revealed risks. Findings contribute to human-centered AI and automationd design.

-   **Design and Evaluation of Machine Learning Interfaces for Reliability Engineers**\
    *Intern, Ericsson, 2023*\
    Our team developed a glyph-based polar (GBP) chart to improve workflow of reliability engineers, enabling comparisons across machine learning models and explanation methods. User testing with Ericsson data scientists showed the GBP chart helped identify key variables and review model outputs.

## Teaching

**Statistics (MIE237); Human-Centered System Design (MIE240); Case Studies in Human Factors and Ergonomics (MIE345)** \
*Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto, 2020-2024*

Mentored 400+ students in statistics, R programming, and human factors with emphasis on
inclusive research practices and mixed-methods approaches including usability testing, controlled experiments, and participatory research; Advised students on projects in human-centered system design for Toronto-based industry partners (e.g., Metro, Voil√†, Kritik) from inception to delivery.

## Research

Summary:

-   Led a team of six researchers on human--automation in operation of small modular reactors (levels of automation, human performance measurement, multi-unit operations)

-   Developed funding proposals for multi-year research programs

-   Led experiments on the effects of machine learning explanations on user performance

-   Consulted on evaluation of machine learning risk

-   Designed and tested ML interfaces for Ericsson's data scientists and reliability engineers

-   Conducted ML analyses for driving insurance risk models

-   Taught statistics and human factors to 400+ engineering students\
