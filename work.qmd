## Current

**Human Factors Consultant**\
Kinectrics

Kinectrics is an engineering consulting firm working in the energy and medical industries. I work in Design and Engineering Services, helping clients ensure that plant, system, and equipment designs are effective and safe for operators across U.S. and Canadian nuclear utilities.

## Projects

Selected past projects:

<!-- ::: {#sample-listings} -->

<!-- ::: -->

-   **Human Performance in Operation of Small Modular Reactors**\
    *Team Lead, University of Toronto, 2025*\
    Experimental research program informing human factors sections of emerging nuclear regulations. Focus areas included human performance measurement, automation integration, and multi-unit operations.

-   **User-in-the-Loop Experiments in Machine Learning Explainability**\
    *PhD researcher, University of Toronto, 2024*\
    Developed cognitive science--based methods to improve the explainability of machine learning models + Designed and conducted user experiments to evaluate user reliance. Findings showed that combining normative, contrastive, and counterfactual explanations can enhance user performance, while revealing potential limitations.

-   **Design and Evaluation of Machine Learning Interfaces for Reliability Engineers**\
    *Intern, Ericsson, 2023*\
    Our team developed a glyph-based polar (GBP) chart to improve workflow of reliability engineers, enabling comparisons across machine learning models and explanation methods. User testing with Ericsson data scientists showed the GBP chart helped identify key variables and review model outputs.

## Research

In earlier research positions, I have:

-   Led a team of six on human--automation research for for small modular reactor operations

-   Increased the human factors evidence base for nuclear regulation

-   Developed funding proposals for multi-year research programs

-   Participated in OECD NEA and SRI research initiative on societal impacts of emerging tech

-   Consulted on evaluation of machine learning risk

-   Designed and tested ML interfaces for Ericsson's data scientists and reliability engineers

-   Conducted ML analyses for driving insurance risk models

-   Taught statistics and human factors to 400+ engineering students
