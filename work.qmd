## Current

**Human Factors Consultant**\
Kinectrics

Kinectrics is an engineering consulting firm working in the energy and medical industries. I work in Design and Engineering Services, helping clients ensure that plant, system, and equipment designs are effective and safe for operators across U.S. and Canadian nuclear utilities.

## Projects

Selected past projects:

-   **Human Performance in Operation of Small Modular Reactors**\
    *Team Lead, University of Toronto, 2025*\
    Directed an experimental research program informing the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission's emerging regulations on small modular reactors (SMRs). Developed proposals for CNSC-NSERC addressing topics such as human performance measurement, automation integration, multi-unit operations, and the impact of SMR deployment on Indigenous communities.

-   **User-in-the-Loop Experiments in Machine Learning Explainability**\
    *PhD researcher, University of Toronto, 2024*\
    Developed cognitive science--based methods to improve the explainability of ML models, and led user experiments to test how different forms of explanation affected decision reliance. Demonstrated that combining normative, contrastive, and counterfactual explanations improved performance but also exposed systemic risks. Findings contributed to human-centered AI design frameworks and research on responsible automation.

-   **Design and Evaluation of Machine Learning Interfaces for Reliability Engineers**\
    *Intern, Ericsson, 2023*\
    Our team developed a glyph-based polar (GBP) chart to improve workflow of reliability engineers, enabling comparisons across machine learning models and explanation methods. Participatory testing with Ericsson data scientists showed the GBP chart helped identify key variables and review model outputs.

## Teaching

**Human-Centered System Design (MIE240); Statistics (MIE237)**\
*Teaching Assistant, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto*

Guided 400+ students in applying participatory design methods with Toronto-based industry partners (Voil√°, Metro, Kritic). Mentored teams to incorporate perspectives of marginalized groups (such as older adults and vision-impaired users) into design solutions, building capacity for inclusive design methods among future engineers. Taught statistics and research methods alongside human-centered design, equipping students to evaluate outcomes and integrate evidence-based approaches.

## Research

Summary:

-   Led a team of six on human--automation research for small modular reactor operations

-   Increased the human factors evidence on contemporary issues in nuclear regulation (human performance measurement, levels of automation, multi-unit operations).

-   Developed funding proposals for multi-year research programs

-   Participated in OECD NEA and SRI research initiatives on societal impacts of technology

-   Led experiments on the effects of post-hoc machine learning explanations on user performance

-   Consulted on evaluation of machine learning risk

-   Designed and tested ML interfaces for Ericsson's data scientists and reliability engineers

-   Conducted ML analyses for driving insurance risk models

-   Taught statistics and human factors to 400+ engineering students
