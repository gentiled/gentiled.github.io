## Current

**Human Factors Consultant**\
Kinectrics

Kinectrics is an engineering consulting firm working in the energy and medical industries. I work in Design and Engineering Services, helping clients ensure that plant, system, and equipment designs are effective and safe for operators across U.S. and Canadian nuclear utilities.

## Projects

Selected past projects:

<!-- ::: {#sample-listings} -->
<!-- ::: -->

-   **Human Performance in Operation of Small Modular Reactors**\
    *Team Lead, University of Toronto, 2025*\
    Experimental research program informing human factors sections of emerging nuclear regulations. Focus areas included human performance measurement, automation integration, and multi-unit operations.

-   **User-in-the-Loop Experiments in Machine Learning Explainability**\
    *PhD researcher, University of Toronto, 2024*\
    Developed cognitive scienceâ€“based methods to improve the explainability of machine learning models + Designed and conducted user experiments to evaluate user reliance. Findings showed that combining normative, contrastive, and counterfactual explanations can enhance user performance, while revealing potential limitations.

-   **Design and Evaluation of Machine Learning Interfaces for Reliability Engineers**\
    *Intern, Ericsson, 2023*\
    Our team developed a glyph-based polar (GBP) chart to improve workflow of reliability engineers, enabling comparisons across machine learning models and explanation methods. User testing with Ericsson data scientists showed the GBP chart helped identify key variables and review model outputs.



## Research

**Postdoctoral Researcher and Team Lead of Experimentation and Analysis**\
University of Toronto (until 2025)

I led a team studying human-automation interaction in small modular reactor operations, directing research that advances the evidence base for nuclear human factors regulations. This work ensured automation and interfaces promote system reliability and operator performance, with funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission.

Key contributions included developing methods to evaluate machine learning model explainability, conducting human-in-the-loop simulations, and participating in OECD Nuclear Energy Agency AI safety initiatives. I also contributed to multi-year research proposals and helped translate research findings into practical regulatory guidance.

**Earlier Research**\

-   Evaluating ML interfaces for reliability engineers at Ericsson's Global AI Accelerator

-   Conducting machine learning analyses for insurance risk models

-   Teaching human factors and statistics at the university level

-   Leading research and consulting projects from conception to completion

This work has earned recognition from the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society and resulted in several peer-reviewed publications.
