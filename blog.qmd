2\. Designing Explainable Interfaces for High-Stakes Decision Making\
You can't train people to trust systems that don't behave predictably. Trust has to be earned at the interface level.\

[1. Trust and Misuse of AI in Critical Ops](memos/ai-memo.qmd)\
How operators over-trust or under-trust AI systems in nuclear or utilities, and the real-world consequences of that. Link it to explainability, automation bias, and system design.\

*Feb 2025*

**Trust and Misuse of AI in Critical Ops**\
How operators over-trust or under-trust AI systems in nuclear or utilities, and the real-world consequences of that. Link it to explainability, automation bias, and system design.

**Cognitive Load in AI-Augmented Control Rooms**\
Break down how AI tools can either help or overwhelm operators. Offer frameworks for measuring and mitigating cognitive overload in real-time operations.

**Human--AI Handover and Intervention Timing**\
Explain why timing matters when handing control between AI and humans, especially in safety-critical systems. Include examples from aviation or process control.

**Designing Explainable Interfaces for High-Stakes Decision Making**\
Not just \"what is XAI,\" but *how* to make it usable by human operators under pressure. Include design patterns or principles.

**Human Error in the Age of AI**\
Challenge the idea that AI eliminates human error---show how it changes the *type* of error, and why that matters for nuclear, grid ops, etc.

**AI in Emergency Scenarios**\
Write about edge cases---what happens when the AI gets it wrong in rare, high-risk conditions? How do you design for human override and situational awareness?

**Human--AI Teaming Metrics**\
Propose ways to *measure* the quality of human--AI collaboration. This is gold for people building or evaluating these systems.
