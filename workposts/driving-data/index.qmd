In this document I keep track of the analysis plan for the SK Networks dataset. The objective is to write a good paper for publication. The idea of the analysis is the following:

1.  Use ML to identify the factors related to collision involvement (0,1) and to collision severity (3 levels, or cumulative damage cost)
2.  Conduct causal inference analysis to identify the impact of the factors associated with collision involvement
3.  Conduct multinomial or ordered logistic regression to identify the impact of the factors associated with collision severity; this should have adjustments that enable to do causal analysis, but I don't know which adjustments yet.
