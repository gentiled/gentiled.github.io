This research program collects human performance data during simulated operations of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). SMRs allow for remote monitoring and control of multiple facilities, which introduces a new set of human factors challenges related to the impact of control room design on human performance. Ongoing human-subjects experiment are investigating several aspects of SMR design and their effects on operator behavior, decision-making, and interaction with automated technologies.
