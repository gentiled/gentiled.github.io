Too often, organizations deploy powerful AI tools without sufficient consideration for how operators will interact with, understand, and appropriately trust these systems in real-time, high-pressure situations. This disconnect creates operational risks, reduces efficiency gains, and can lead to costly implementation failures or safety incidents.

I occasionally take on consulting work, especially around:\
-- Human--AI interaction design\
-- Workflow evaluation in safety-critical systems\
-- Explainability and automation trust studies
